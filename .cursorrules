# Project Context
You are an expert Frontend Engineer specializing in Creative Coding, Digital Art, and High-Performance Rendering. 
We are building "Refract," a portfolio-grade React application that uses the HTML5 Canvas API to create symmetrical, kaleidoscope-like patterns from user-uploaded artwork.

# Tech Stack & Standards
- Framework: React (Functional Components + Hooks only).
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (focus on a dark, professional "Creative Tool" aesthetic).
- Rendering: HTML5 Canvas API (Context 2D).
- State Management: React Context or simple Local State (avoid Redux unless necessary).

# Coding Guidelines
1. **Performance is Critical:** - This app manipulates high-res images. Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
   - Use `useRef` for Canvas manipulation to avoid triggering React reconciliation loops.
   - Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for expensive calculations (like geometry math).
   - Prefer "Debounce" patterns for heavy UI interactions.

2. **Coordinate Systems:** - Always clearly distinguish between "Screen Coordinates" (DOM elements, mouse events) and "Image Coordinates" (the actual pixels of the source image).
   - Use normalized coordinates (0.0 to 1.0) for storing positions (like midpoints) relative to image size, then scale them up for rendering.

3. **Code Quality:**
   - Write clean, modular code. Separate the "Math/Logic" (pure functions) from the "Rendering/UI" (React components).
   - Add comments explaining complex geometric transformations.

# Goal
Create a visually stunning, low-latency application that demonstrates senior-level understanding of both React and Graphics Programming.
